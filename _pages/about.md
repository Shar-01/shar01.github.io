Hello World!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich, specializing in AI, robotics, and human-machine interaction. My research spans applying continual learning, multitask learning, learning from simulated interactions, and multimodal learning in the context of adaptive learning for intelligent rehabilitation agents. I have also worked on projects related to vision-based learning of the interactions and dynamics of moving objects from videos and have collaborated with NASA JPL, focusing on autonomous exploration in perceptually degraded environments.
